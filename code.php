<p>
The software to track a moving worm and generate illumination patterns targeted at specific neurons or muscle is called  MindControl. MindControl was written in C by Andrew Leifer using the open source <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> computer vision library. The source code for mindcontrol is avaiable <a href="http://github.com/samuellab/mindcontrol">through GitHub</a>. Mind control also runs in a simulation mode, so anyone with a Windows computer can download the <a href="https://github.com/downloads/samuellab/mindcontrol/MindControlDEMO.zip">Mindcontrol Demo</a> package and run the software using included video of a swimming worm.
